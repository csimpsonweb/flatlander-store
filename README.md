This repo holds the Angular project that I am currently working on via [Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com). This is my first introduction to using Angular.js, and it is awesome.

What I'm Learning:
-----
* Setting up a basic app by importing BootStrap 3 and Angular.js
* Various Angular Directives
* Some Angular Filters
* Creating Controllers in the app.js file
* How to inject different values of an object's properties

### What's Next  
After completing this tutorial, I plan on creating my own app using mostly everything taught in this course. Additionally, I want to learn Node.js, so I might tie in a database to an app with Angular.js on the front - wish me luck!
